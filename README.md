# notebooks
These are some Python notebooks I have created.
So far, along with a project partner (credited in the files), Jasmine Wu, we have created files.
These files are for basic Python learning, as well as the NumPy and Pandas libraries.
We are currently working on a visualizations notebook which I will slowly add to this repository.
